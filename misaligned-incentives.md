## Misaligned Incentives

The architecture is concentrated in single entity and misaligned incentives which lead to market distrotion and corruption. As a lender of last resort RBI will assis commercial banks who get in trouble in terms of financial solvency.

In the time of financial crisis RBI went so far as to issue new reserve and use them purchase new financial assets. This does not increased the debt because it is like moving money from one pocket to another pocket. However , RBI is no taking low quality financial assets as collateral.

These decisions from the RBI makes perfect sense based on their stated goals; bankruptcies in the financial industry can have widespread impact, and the actions did appear to stop the problem for the time being. Unfortunately it’s now been made clear to commercial banks that they can lend recklessly and invest in riskier assets, aiming for outsized returns but knowing that if they fail the losses will be socialized and passed on to taxpayers.

It’s created the infamous “Too big to fail” institutions, ones that are so intertwined with the Indian economy that bankers and politicians believe they must be protected at all costs. They aren’t wrong to be concerned; if these institutions were allowed to collapse it would have a terrible impact on the Indian economy and world economy. But had they been initially allowed to fail when they made reckless lending decisions, banks would be forced to be more conservative in both the amount of reserves they hold and the quality of their loans, reducing the risk to the system without a tax-payer funded guarantee.

Central bank policy is also subject to political influence. Central bankers are tasked with acting independtly but RBI governors are appointed to thier position by PM. There decisions have a huge impact on economy the exit of Raghuram Rajan clearly shows sign of favourable candidate to PM.

There is additional pressure on central banks from private and commercial investors as central banks policy distorts the decisions. Investors carfeully watch the RBI and central banks for sign of what thier next move will be regarding interest rates.

Additional side effect of the temptation for government to use thier central banks to fund govt debts a process known as seniorage. Central banks issue new currency and use it buy govt bonds after which govt can use the new cash to finance whatever they want. Benefit of seniorage is that resulting inflation reduces the cost of existing debt but it depends highly on your currency reserves. Countries like Argentina, Venezuela made worst policy decisions in past which led to rapid expansion of money supply and inflation and ultimately where country can no longer pay the govt debts.

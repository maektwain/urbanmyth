Urban myth breaks paradigm about blockchain tehcnology from socialistic and capitalistic point of view.

## Analysis on following.

1. Banking  : How banking segment has changed the course of history , from Mafia's to common citizen putting trust on someone else hand especially 
when bank's lend your money to someone else to earn money known as fractional reserve breaking the myth behind bankin analysing the structure 
and methods which these bank have adopted through 18th century till now. What has changed?.

2. Technology : Accounting requires credit and debit where every ardous operations of constantly writing and reading data from centralised database
has changed the world inside the banking. We find how technology has supported or increased the headache of banks or the customer.

3. Commons : What is common wealth how one defines the spirit of work which goes transnational without any boundaries breaking all the barries.
Everything around us reflect the human will even the banking and technology cannot evade out of it. We understand the commons how in the history 
we have been able to manipulate the pleothera of data on our desires to obtain results as we want.

4. Money : Unit of account , exchange of value and store of value lets see how this definition has taken a huge leap of shift from credit to debit
not only the problem which has been there lying since the dawn of human civilisation we will anaylse what money is and how it has changed everything.

5. Algorithms : Are we overhyping this or we have achived the state of singularity using algorithm which can make descions on our behalf where one
can be trustless and connect and interact with machines without any trust and can also interact using other human beings. Is it pre-future ?

6. Data : What is data in 21st Century, Does it really help ? It is coming to our knowledge that data has some issues where wether algorithms are biased or 
are they making perfect descions understanding how data really reflect our choices or it says something else.

7. Human : Understanding how do we behave when we are encountered with the absolute reality and how does our mind create patterns and trust others in
this social fabric where one is always connected with others and the problem of human relationship with each other.

This book will cover finance to humanity and focus on social transformation which it brings understands and anlayse topics like politics and 
capitalistic behaviour, co-relating with Algorithms and how machine interaction can save us from extinction or are we going to doomsday?

Climate change, corruption all account for same thing from scandals involving politicians siphoning off billions of dollars for what? For living 
good life. Is there something else behind the picture why 1 % holds the power to govern the rest. Topics like consensus and self amendment are 
discoverd in this book.

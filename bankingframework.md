## Status quo

Modern financial systems have enabled rapid economic expansion and improved the lives of billions around the world. However, the fundamental design of the system has led to an unreasonable concentration of wealth and power in the hands of those who manage it. Financial crises are a matter of when, not if, and third world countries have not experienced nearly the same benefits as those in the first world.


## Current model of central banks

Central banks acts as bankers bank, where finacial institutions provide services to individuals central banks provide services to financial institutions.

The most important task of the RBI is managing the supply of INR through a process known as monetary policy. The goals of this policy are sustainable economic growth, full employment, and stable prices. Through monetary policy the RBI and other central banks attempt to “tweak” the economy to the right levels. For example, if the economy is showing signs of slowing growth, the RBI may determine that it’s best to lower interest rates. As interest rates decline more individuals and businesses are willing to borrow to finance investments, purchases, or other forms of financial activity, increasing overall spending in the Indian economy.

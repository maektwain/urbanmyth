## Status quo

Modern financial systems have enabled rapid economic expansion and improved the lives of billions around the world. However, the fundamental design of the system has led to an unreasonable concentration of wealth and power in the hands of those who manage it. Financial crises are a matter of when, not if, and third world countries have not experienced nearly the same benefits as those in the first world.


## Current model of central banks

Central banks acts as bankers bank, where finacial institutions provide services to individuals central banks provide services to financial institutions.

The most important task of the RBI is managing the supply of INR through a process known as monetary policy. The goals of this policy are sustainable economic growth, full employment, and stable prices. Through monetary policy the RBI and other central banks attempt to “tweak” the economy to the right levels. For example, if the economy is showing signs of slowing growth, the RBI may determine that it’s best to lower interest rates. As interest rates decline more individuals and businesses are willing to borrow to finance investments, purchases, or other forms of financial activity, increasing overall spending in the Indian economy.

Central banks affect the money supply

## Value of Rupee

Many economist will tell you that Rupee has value due to social acceptance and use of Rupee as medium of exchange. But people wouldn't accept it as a medium of exchange unless they belived it has a true value. This sort of circular reasoning is not sufficient for explaining value of rupee.

Alternative understanding is that Rupee has it value from because of credit and the expected repayment of debts.

1. Indian govt. exclusively conducts all of the financial transactions in Rupee,  govt. accepts Rupee for taxes and ensuring there is a significant demand of it.
2. Commercial banks are in the business of using custome desposits as investment capital or to issue loans to other businesses, Indian FI are required by law to accept Rupee as form of repayment and deposits.
3. The RBI like any other bank has a balance sheet which contains liabilities and assets. Assets are mostly Indian govt. debts and liabilities are typically reserves.

There is nothing behind or intrinsic value of rupee it is just full faith and credit of INR as long as people are paying taxes in Rupee.

Each country has its own central bank which is issuing currency backed by govt debts. Commercial banks loan this currency to businesses and consumer for use in capital investment, payment of wages. The result is interalted complexity with systematic risk. The value of currency depends on perception of the Indian govt ability to repay and performance of economy. Commercial banks health is tied to its ability to collect on outstanding liabilities.

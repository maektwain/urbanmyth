## Free Banking 

An alternative to state supported and sponsored financial system. It is rooted in the belief that private actors can provide a
better, more stable currency than that by govt.

## Market Driven Alternative

In free market. firms who provide better services win out over inferior ones as consumers switch thier demand to superior offering.
Similarly in free banking individual banks create and maintain currency and consumers are free to pick the currency that suits.

Debtors will take inflationary currency.
Lenders and savers will go for deflationary currency.

A free banking system can eliminate the moral hazard created by central banks operating as a lender of last resort. In free banking each bank is responsible for its own solvency and required to hold adequate reserves to ensure it is able to meet all of the withdrawal demand

## History of Free banking
 
The prime example being England during the late 1700s. At one point the system was so successful that the citizens of England preferred private coins over those provided by the Bank Of England. The private coins were more widely circulated, 
 in particular in the industrial areas of Northern England.
 
An example:

``` During this time period an important counter example was unfolding just north in Canada. 
Canadian banks were relatively uninhibited in their currency issuance; they were chartered by 
the government, 
creating a barrier to entry, but outside of that practiced what we’ve outlined as free banking. 
Each bank was able to print their own currency and match supply with demand as they saw fit, 
in addition to practicing branch banking which allowed them to diversify geographically.
Over the same 20 year period that saw half of all USD removed from circulation, 
Canada’s money supply resembled that of a saw tooth pattern. 
During agricultural harvests the demand for currency increased as it was needed for 
trading goods that were coming to market.
After the harvest season was over the demand fell, 
and the banks removed currency from circulation to absorb the 
reduction in demand. The system of decentralized banks
using local knowledge and flexibility to meet currency
demand was far superior to that of the US’s system.```


How we reached here?

The English central bank model has since become the central banking model used around the world, 
leading to the modern standard where currency production is almost exclusively a right of the state. 
We believe that the solution to fixing modern banking is to increase transparency and eliminate the favoritism 
that allows individuals and institutions to act recklessly and without recourse.


What is uPort?


We want to give consumers visibility into the health of the bank and an opportunity to vote with their wallet.

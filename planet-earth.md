The human being came into existence which is still most arguable and controversial . No one exactly know from where and how using which technology human being came into be. There are multiple theories around it but none of them are so far able to establish any reasonable and rational finding which all human being can correspond to.

1. We came from planet earth and we are the only one in this universe. \(Wrong\)
2. Theory from outer space \(Somehow true\)
